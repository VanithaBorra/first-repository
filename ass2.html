            Not of brick and mortar, but of divs and blocks.
            With HTML's brush and CSS's flair,
            They craft the web, a canvas to share.</pre></p><br>
            
           <p> <pre>
            Undeterred by errors, they debug with grace,
            A colon misplaced, a bracket out of place.

            The user experience, a masterpiece anew.</pre>

            For the web is their playground, a frontier to tame,
            And with every line of code, they'll write their own name.
