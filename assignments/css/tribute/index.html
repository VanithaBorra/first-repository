    <h1>Tokyo 2020 bronze-winning PV Sindhu gets grand reception in Delhi</h1>    
    <p>The badminton ace is the first Indian woman to win two Olympic medals. PV Sindhu had won silver at Rio 2016.</p>
    <p>PV Sindhu became the first Indian woman, and second Indian after Sushil Kumar, to win two Olympic medals as she defeated He Bing Jiao of China 21-13, 21-15 for the badminton women’s singles bronze at Tokyo 2020.</p>
    <p> Over 53 minutes at the Musashino Forest Sport Plaza court 1, PV Sindhu overcame the fighting abilities of the Chinese left-hander to join Mirabai Chanu and Lovlina Borgohain as India’s medallists at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>It was PV Sindhu’s second Olympic medal after her silver at Rio 2016. </p>
    <p>Apart from the semi-final against Tai Tzu Ying, Sindhu’s Tokyo campaign covered all bases, showing almost no weakness with terrific court coverage and net play. To her trademark aggression she added the flexibility to not be pinned into the deep corners and was able to quickly convert defensive positions into attacking ones. Calmly closing out matches, she didn’t drop a single game in her five wins.</p>
    <p>Against He Bing Jiao, the opening rally itself was 22 strokes, and PV Sindhu took it with a nicely disguised drop to the forehand forecourt. A quicker crosscourt into the same region gave her a 4-0 headstart.</p>
    <p>He Bing Jiao erased that advantage, moving PV Sindhu around in a 34-stroke rally and using body shots and deep, flat drives to win points.</p>
    <p>While the 24-year old Chinese made PV Sindhu lunge often to the backhand side of the net, Sindhu was forcing her opponent to do the same on the forehand side.</p>
    <p>PV Sindhu’s power weighed in; twice He Bing Jiao recovered to retrieve big smashes, but Sindhu had a third in store to nail the point. A down-the-line smash followed as the 26-year old Indian went into the break at 11-8.</p>
    <p>
        The Indian was dictating terms now, her recently-polished mixture of aggression and net play giving He Bing Jiao little breathing space. The Chinese was on the floor as a crosscourt smash flew to her left for Sindhu to go ahead 15-9.

    </p>
    <p>
        Like Tai Tzu-Ying had done against her in the semi-final, PV Sindhu ran away with the game 21-13, the ferocity of her charge complemented with deceptive crosscourt drops continuing to draw errors from He Bing Jiao.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just how much PV Sindhu’s craft has evolved was apparent early in the second game. Sending He Bing Jiao scurrying from left to right, Sindhu came up with a drop-slice Tai would have been proud of. With the Chinese pinned on the forehand edge, the Indian’s next shot was a ripper of a smash to the backhand corner.
    </p>
    <p>She is only 26, a legend of Indian sport even as she continues to relentlessly add pages into an already epic story of greatness. Since breaking through as a teenager, PV Sindhu has consistently saved her best for big stages of her sport. And delivered, with relentless certainty.</p>
    <p>We haven’t seen anything like it in Indian sport. On Sunday, she mined a bronze, her second medal in the Olympics, to add another celebrated chapter to her grand legacy.</p>
    <p>Sindhu is now the only Indian woman to medal twice at the Olympics. Add the five pieces of metal she has won at the World Championships and you have a career that is truly unparalleled in Indian sport, independent of gender.</p>
